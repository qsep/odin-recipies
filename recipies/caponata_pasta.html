<h4><i> Ingredients</i></h4>
<ul>
    <p>4 tbsp olive oil (or use the oil from your chargrilled veg, see below)</p>
    <p>1 large onion, finely chopped</p>
    <p>4 garlic cloves, finely sliced</p>
    <p>250g chargrilled Mediterranean veg (peppers and aubergines, if possible) from a jar, pot or deli counter, drained if in oil (you can use this oil in place of the olive oil) and roughly chopped</p>
    <p>400g can chopped tomatoes</p>
    <p>1 tbsp small capers</p>
    <p>2 tbsp raisins</p>
    <p>350g rigatoni, penne or another short pasta shape</p>
    <p>bunch basil leaves, picked</p>
</ul>

<h4><i> Method</i></h4>
<ol>
    <li></li><p>Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion for 8-10 mins until starting to caramelise (or for longer if you have time â€“ the sweeter the better). Add the garlic for the final 2 mins of cooking time.</p>
    <li></li><p>Tip in the mixed veg, tomatoes, capers and raisins. Season well and simmer, uncovered, for 10 mins, or until you have a rich sauce.</p>
    <li></li><p>Meanwhile, boil the kettle. Pour the kettleful of water into a large pan with a little salt and bring back to the boil. Add the pasta and cook until tender with a little bite, then drain, reserving some of the pasta water. Tip the pasta into the sauce, adding a splash of pasta water if it needs loosening. Scatter with the basil leaves and parmesan, if you like, and serve straight from the pan</p>
